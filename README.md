# ITWS2110-GroupProject-RPINoteExchange
The group project repo for ITWS2110 Fall2017 group 5

## Project Proposal
### Summary:
This project aims to make the process of sharing, exchanging, or requesting notes and books among Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute students easier. By creating a website organized for different majors and classes within that major could support students in their academic endeavors. Students will be prompted to log in using their RPI credentials to access the website to ensure that the website is a secure network of academic information exclusively for RPI students. Once logged in, students can either find the subject of the class or their major as well as search for any specific classes to find required texts or notes. Students will also have the ability to upload notes or books that they would like to share. All of this uploaded information will be stored in a database for any RPI student to access, this project hopes to aid students in succeeding academically as well as save money on required texts. Lastly, the website will be a platform for students to chat and communicate with other students to share helpful course information or speak to students that have previously taken courses they may be interested in taking. 

### Description of each type of user and stakeholder, and how the site generates value for each:
Users: There are two types of users. Those who are looking for notes, and those who are sharing their notes. Those who are looking for notes will be happy that they will be able to find notes and other course material for RPI classes easily. They can look up a specific class they are in and find all of the notes people have posted as well as the required text if available. The other type of user is the one who will share their notes. Some people like to share their notes just because they like helping others. The value it generates for them is the goodness they feel in their heart. Other people may feel that if they are using the site, they may as well contribute to it too.

This is mainly intended to be a free to use site to exchange notes, so there are not too many stakeholders.


### Technologies to be used:
* HTML/CSS - Used for site layout and design.
* PHP/SQL - Used to store data about books, notes, etc.
* JavaScript - Used for anything like drop down menus to pick a subject, any special interactions with the page like hiding/showing certain information with clicks.

### Functional/Non-Functional Requirements:
* Uploading Files: Functional requirement as it is a major component to the aim of the website. If there is no ability to upload files there will be nothing for students to share. 

* Communication Forum: Functional requirement as communication between students would be extremely beneficial, especially in larger lecture classes where students may not interact at all. 

* Organized Database of Files: Functional requirement as a database is necessary to contain all of the files and must be organized into different subjects for easy access for students. 

* Organization by Major: Nonfunctional requirement as classes all have a four digit class code that will be an easier system to find as opposed to following a majorâ€™s curriculum since there are many free elective classes or classes that students choose to take based on interest and not their major. However, if possible this could be a useful feature to guide students throughout their college career or be able to look at curriculums for other majors they may like to switch too and find classes or notes that might help them. 

* User Login System: Nonfunctional requirement, although it would be extremely beneficial for all of this information to be help privately just for RPI students, the site will pertain to specific RPI courses and if a login system is not feasible it is okay as students should still have access to additional academic help and support. 

* Search Component/Search Bar: Functional requirement because it will allow for much easier access to specific information for the user.

* Functional and User Friendly Website: Functional requirement as users will need to be able to easily access the information as they need, students will need help and support in a fast and efficient way and a clean and easy to use design will allow for this.
